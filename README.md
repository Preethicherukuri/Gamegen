# 🎮 GameGen – Ultimate Game Template Collection

**GameGen** is a curated collection of browser-based game templates developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features three classic and customizable games designed for rapid prototyping, gamified learning, or integration into web-based applications. Each game supports level progression, theming, and responsive design principles.
